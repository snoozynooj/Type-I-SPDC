# Type-I-SPDC
Different folder is for calculating different things.
## **Phase_Matching + G2 + Photon_Count** 
This folder is all about producing phase-matching angles, g<sub>(2)</sub> and photon count. There is a file called the database which has information about all the crystals used in this study. 

Description of database file: *Column 1:* Name of crystals *Column 2:* Type of crystal *Column 3:* Band gap of the crystal *Column 4:* Signal wavelength for SPDC





After you run deff.sh file, it will produce *.csv files corresponding to the crystal and *-result file. For example
### TAKRIJ-2dmap.csv
Column 1 is deff value in pm/V, Coulmn 2 is theta value and Column 3 is phi value
### TAKRIJ-result
