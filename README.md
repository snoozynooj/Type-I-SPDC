# Type-I-SPDC
Different folder is for calculating different things.
# **2d-Map-deff**: 
This folder will is all about produce d_eff map for any given biaxial crystals as function of theta (0 to 180) and phi (0 to 360). A file name called database in this folder have all the information about the crystals which is required by deff.sh file.
Description of database file:
Column 1 : Name of crystals
Column 2 : Type of crystal
Column 3 : Band gap of the crystal
Column 4 : Signal wavelength for SPDC

After you run deff.sh file, it will produce *.csv files corresponding to the crystal.
